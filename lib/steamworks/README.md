*Part* of the [Steamworks SDK](https://partner.steamgames.com/downloads/list), sdk/public/steam - but only the parts necessary for Socials Integration to function.

Different to Controllable, this also includes the .lib to link against.

Is there a better way to include this without copying every single header + the lib?
